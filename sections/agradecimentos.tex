I would like to express my gratitude to my family for all the support and encouragement throughout this journey.

To the members of the examining board, Prof. MÃ¡rcio de Medeiros Ribeiro and Prof. Rafael Maiani de Mello, for kindly accepted the invitation to participate and collaborate with this dissertation.

To the research group EASY and my classmates for the uncountable kindnesses and the companionship that guided my entire trajectory in this difficult challenge.

Especially, I'd like to thank my advisor Prof. Baldoino Fonseca dos Santos Neto for all his patience, support and constructive criticism during this period. This work, as in every major challenge in life, was made up of good and bad times. But it was the bad times that made me understand how important a good orientation work is in the life of a student.
